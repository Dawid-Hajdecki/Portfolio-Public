                        Hello, my name is Dawid Hajdecki, First-class graduate in Web and Mobile Development at the University of the West of Scotland. Every day, I seek knowledge in order to develop and improve my personal and technical skills. I always find learning new technologies and techniques fulfilling.
                        <br/><br/>Throughout my coding experience, I haven't used many source-code editors, but the one that I did fall in love with, was Visual Studio Code. Other programs which I am familiar with or that I choose to use, are: Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and After Effects (These are sorted by the time spent on each one, photoshop being the one I'm most comfortable with).
                        <br/><br/>Talking in front of a group of people, being easily distracted, and having lack of confidence and experience in the industry, are some things that I am currently improving on. On the other hand, I am patient, creative, reliable and passionate. Also, I adapt easily, I have great debugging skills and I am a creative problem solver.
